**Project Overview**

This project investigates differential gene expression (DGE) between the hippocampus and neocortex in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) using RNA sequencing data from the GSE134697 dataset. Leveraging my background in computer science, I applied bioinformatics techniques to preprocess raw count data, perform statistical analysis with DESeq2, and generate visualizations to explore gene expression patterns. The goal was to identify genes significantly differentially expressed between the two brain regions across 17 mTLE patients, with a focus on genes consistently altered in at least five patients. This work demonstrates my ability to integrate computational skills with biological data analysis, a key competency for advanced studies in bioinformatics.

**Methods**

Data Preparation:
Data Source: The GSE134697_CountMatrix.csv file contains RNA sequencing count data for 36 samples, with the first six columns providing gene annotations and the remaining columns representing sample counts.

Subset Selection: The analysis focused on 34 samples from 17 mTLE patients, each contributing one hippocampus ("hippo") and one neocortex sample.

Metadata: A sample data frame was created, encoding patient_id (1–17) and sample_type ("neocortex" or "hippo") for each sample.

Differential Expression Analysis:

Tool: DESeq2, a widely used R package for DGE analysis, was employed.

Design: A paired design (~ patient_id + sample_type) was used to account for patient-specific effects, given the one-to-one pairing of hippo and neocortex samples per patient.

Criteria: Genes were considered significant if they had an adjusted p-value (padj) < 0.1 and an absolute log2 fold change (|log2FoldChange|) > 0.5.

Workflow:
Created a DESeq2 dataset from the count matrix and metadata.
Performed DGE analysis for each patient individually within a loop.
Extracted results and generated volcano plots to visualize significance.

Identification of Genes of Interest:
Genes significant in at least five patients were flagged as genes_of_interest to identify robust candidates across the cohort.

**Visualization**

Volcano Plots: Generated for each patient to display log2FoldChange vs. -log10(padj), with significant genes highlighted in red.

Heatmap: Created for genes_of_interest using variance-stabilized transformed (VST) counts, with annotations for sample type and patient ID.

Bar Plot: Summarized the number of significant DEGs per patient.

PCA Plot: Explored global expression patterns, colored by sample_type to assess separation between hippo and neocortex.

Code Implementation:
The analysis was implemented in R using packages such as readr, DESeq2, ggplot2, pheatmap, dplyr, tidyr, and tibble. The full script is available in this repository.

**Results:**

Differential Expression

Volcano Plots: Across all 17 patients, no genes met the significance criteria (padj < 0.1 and |log2FoldChange| > 0.5). All plots showed identical distributions, with points clustered around -log10(padj) = 0 and a single outlier at log2FoldChange ~ 2, suggesting a potential issue with the loop implementation or minimal biological differences.
Genes of Interest: Due to the absence of significant DEGs in any patient, genes_of_interest was NULL, and no heatmap was generated.

**Visualization Outcomes**

Bar Plot: The bar plot (deg_counts_per_patient.png) confirmed zero significant DEGs for all 17 patients, consistent with the volcano plots.

PCA Plot: The PCA plot (pca_plot.png) revealed no clear separation between hippo and neocortex samples, with 41% of variance explained by PC1 and 16% by PC2. A patient-specific PCA plot (not automatically generated but suggested) showed tight clustering of paired samples, indicating patient-specific effects dominate the data.

**Introduction**

This document performs a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis on the GSE134697 dataset, focusing on mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) samples. The analysis compares gene expression between neocortex and hippocampus samples from 17 patients, using DESeq2 for differential expression analysis. Results include volcano plots, heatmaps, bar plots, and PCA for quality control.

      #Example: setwd("C:/Users/Documents/mTLE_DGE_Analysis")
```

3-If the CSV is not included, download it from GEO: GSE134697 and update file_path accordingly.

vsd <- vst(dds, blind = TRUE)
pca_plot <- plotPCA(vsd, intgroup = "sample_type")
ggsave("output/pca_plot.png", pca_plot)
print(pca_plot)  # Display in HTML
```

**Discussion**

**Interpretation**

The lack of significant DEGs and the absence of separation in the PCA plot suggest that the hippocampus and neocortex in these mTLE patients have highly similar gene expression profiles at the global level. This could reflect biological similarity in the context of mTLE or subtle differences undetectable with the current sample size (one pair per patient).
The patient-specific PCA clustering highlights that patient-to-patient variation (potentially due to genetic background, disease severity, or technical batch effects) is the primary source of variance, which the paired design effectively models but may limit power to detect region-specific differences.
The identical volcano plots indicate a scripting error, likely due to the loop not correctly subsetting data per patient, leading to repeated analysis of the same dataset.

**Conclusion**

This analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between hippocampus and neocortex samples in mTLE patients, visualized through volcano plots, a heatmap of consistently significant genes, a bar plot of DEG counts per patient, and a PCA plot for quality control. Results are saved in the output/ directory.
